## 1.Introduction to Java
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 (now owned by Oracle). Known for its platform independence, Java allows developers to "write once, run anywhere" through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is widely used for building everything from web and mobile applications to large-scale enterprise systems.
